## 🚀 Next Steps for New Session

To continue development in a new chat session, focus on:

1. **WebSocket Server Implementation**
   ```typescript
   // Complete the Socket.io server setup in server.js
   // Integrate with existing socket helpers
   // Test real-time features
   ```

2. **Testing Setup**
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom
   # Create jest.config.js
   # Write first tests for critical components
   ```

3. **Performance Optimization**
   ```typescript
   // Implement React.lazy for route-based code splitting
   // Add next/dynamic for component lazy loading
   // Configure next/image for optimization
   ```

4. **AI Features Planning**
   ```typescript
   // Design AI service architecture
   // Choose AI provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
   // Implement recommendation engine
   ```

## 📊 Project Metrics
- **Completion Status**: ~75% of v2 features implemented
- **Code Quality**: Good structure, TypeScript throughout
- **Security**: Strong authentication and authorization
- **Performance**: Basic optimization, needs improvement
- **Testing**: 0% coverage - critical gap

## 🔧 Technical Debt
1. Console.log statements need proper logging framework
2. Some error handling could be improved
3. WebSocket integration incomplete
4. No API versioning strategy
5. Missing rate limiting on some endpoints

## 💡 Recommendations
1. **Immediate**: Complete WebSocket server for real-time features
2. **Short-term**: Add comprehensive testing suite
3. **Medium-term**: Implement AI features for competitive advantage
4. **Long-term**: Build mobile apps using React Native
